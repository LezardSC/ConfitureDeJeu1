Project for the Game Jam 'Confiture de Jeu 1' in Lyon in March 2024. The game was made in 48h.
The theme was 'beware of appearances'. Our game is a platformer where the main character can put a mask to reveal hidden platforms.

Unfortunately, we didn't finished the game, but we had fun and have learned a lot!
